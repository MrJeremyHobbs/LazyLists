# LazyLists
LazyLists allows a user to scan the barcode of an item in hand and add that item to a physical items set in Alma. The user can then run a job on that set, export to a spreadsheet, or any other function that can be performed on a set in Alma.

Simply scan a barcode (or type with the keyboard if the label is too worn for scanning). LazyLists will indicate if the process was successful or if there were any problems.

You can download the latest release of LazyLists by clicking the releases tab above or by clicking [here](https://github.com/MrJeremyHobbs/LazyLists/releases).
